# MagicDisks
Magical disks, what else is there to say

This is a VR Unity Project created for my Senior project at 
University. It is a proof of concept and lacks a proper tutorial but
is the start to a puzzle game.


Here's a video of the game in action. All in game sound effects are free use,
All in game music was created by me
